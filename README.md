# House_Price_Prediction
House price prediction is an important concept in the real estate industry. Thus, many researchers from different fields are interested in developing a regression model for the house price to obtain an accurate prediction and explore the factors affecting the house price. The generalized model must neither experience under fitting nor over fitting, for us to get the best result.  This work tested seven different models: LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, DecisionTreeRegressor, Support vector machines (SVM), and RandomForestRegressor. RandomForestRegressor was found to be the best, giving the highest training and test accuracy and with smallest RMSE
